> A Github Action that engage your early supporter when they star your repo

## 📜 Background

Basically, giving a star to a project is the first step of support from any Github user.

When a user decide to give a star to your project, it means he has a minimum of interest in your project.

That interest is exactly what matter the most for small Open source project that has a hard time to engage or getting feedback on their work.

So it's time for us, small open source project, to be pro-active, engage and thanks anyone that give us some light 🔥.

## 💁 Description

Basically everytime a Github User will Star ⭐ your repository this action will:

* Notify you on discord
* Look after the Github profile of your supporter
  * Follow them
  * Check if this supporter has a personal profile repository
    * Give a star to they personal profile repository
    * Create an issue in the personal profile repository with your selected message
  * Check if the supporter link his twitter account to his Github account
    * Create a tweet tagging our supporter

## 🏁 Flow

* A **Stargazer** is a person that give a star to a project.
